## Nemo

Nemo is our robot for 500g Autonomous Sumo tournaments and battles. His debut was during the [Second Tech Challenge Tournament](https://challonge.com/pt_BR/tcMini) under the name Parzival. He was built using a [Pololu Zumo Chassi](https://www.pololu.com/product/2510) lent by a generous team member, and a [Arduino Pro Mini](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-pro-mini) for the microcontroller, also lent by a generous team member.

## TO DO

- Actual mechanics and parts table
- Branch organization for previous and upcoming events (?)
